# Python Pandas Practice Repository <img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/P/pandas-logo-56829C6445-seeklogo.com.png" alt="Pandas Logo" width="100" style="vertical-align: middle;" />
I created this repository to practice using the Python library **Pandas**. This library is widely used to analyze and gain better insights from data.

I've written code to manipulate data, perform various analyses, and transform datasets to make information more accessible and meaningful.

I'm also practicing my English, so once a week, I plan to create an entire project in English.
